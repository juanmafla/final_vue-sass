<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:8pt;">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. If transactions are processed on the website, transaction information is transmitted to and from the website in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. We restrict authorized access to your personal information to those persons who have a legitimate purpose to know that information to provide products or services to you and those persons you have authorized to have access to such information.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:8pt;">Delivery On-Demand follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Delivery On-Demand receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Delivery On-Demand strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp;</p>

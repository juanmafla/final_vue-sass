The user must detail the delivery information of the package, such as the location and address of delivery, as well as the specifications and measurements of the package.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>When the user makes a booking through our platform, Delivery On-Demand will select the drivers or driver that best suits their specific job from a list of potential drivers that have requested the specific job.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In the event that the delivery does not have any potential drivers who have requested the specific job and will deliver within a reasonable time,&nbsp;Delivery On Demand&nbsp;will attempt to contact the user to modify the booking and schedule a different pickup and delivery time, in the event that this is not possible,&nbsp;Delivery On Demand&nbsp;reserves the right to cancel the booking and provide a refund.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:8pt;"><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;Services booked for same day pick-up must be received before 11:00 am. Services booked after 11:00 am will be processed for the following day.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:8pt;">A repeat collection/delivery charge will apply if no one is present to receive or deliver the goods. This repeat charge must be paid prior to pick up or redelivery and will be charged depending on location, package measurements and required delivery date and time.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:8pt;">If the freight delivery is on Euro/standard pallets, please ensure that the package is well wrapped and adequately protected for onward transportation.
